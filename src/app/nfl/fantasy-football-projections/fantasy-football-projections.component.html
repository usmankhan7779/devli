        Fantasy football may be the most popular game in the country right now, which means the competition in your daily and season-long leagues is going to be extremely fierce. The only way to truly get a leg up on your opponents is by having a source of consistent and reliable fantasy football projections. These projections will be done for every game of the season, and they will give you an idea of what type of performance you can expect from every player. It is extremely important to use some type of projection service when playing fantasy football because you are basically playing a difficult guessing game without them. No matter how many NFL games you watch, it is impossible to know detailed information pertaining to every player and team in the league. Since NFL fantasy projections are done using expert analysis and data science, you do not have to worry about following every small detail of the league. The projections are simply going to be more accurate than anything you try to create on your own. Every successful fantasy football player in the world is using weekly projections, so you need to add them to your repertoire if you truly want a chance to win.

        A lot of important information is used to create the NFL fantasy projections on a daily basis including recent performances, historic data, injuries, weather and opposing matchups. This data is then used to create an accurate projection of every player's performance in their upcoming game. NFL fantasy projections can be wildly different from week to week because football is such a matchup dependent game.

        A talented wide receiver is going to have a much harder time finding a way to score points when playing against the best cornerback in the league than he would against a poor defense. The same can be said for the other skill positions on a fantasy football team. The expected outcome of the real game also has a big influence on the fantasy projections. A running back is going to have a hard time scoring a lot of fantasy points if his team is expected to lose the game in a blowout. Since his team will likely spend most of the game passing in attempt to score quickly, that does not bode well for the running back.

        You may look at our NFL fantasy projections and think that they are too low for most players, but that is common with projections. The goal is to provide a projected point total that is closer to their average or within reasonable standard deviations of the mean. Outlier projection totals can’t be relied upon and for this reason, you won’t see outrageous projection numbers.  While it is certainly possible for the top quarterback in the league to throw for six touchdowns, the projections will never expect this type of performance. Those high-scoring games only happen a few times a year, so they are extreme outliers. The goal is to have all of projected fantasy point totals to be within one or two standard deviations of the mean. This results in slightly lower projected scoring totals, but that will actually help your fantasy football team win on a consistent basis.
